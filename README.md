**Web-Based Platform for Cattle Feed Optimization**

Project Overview:
This project focuses on cattle feed optimization, leveraging a web-based platform to analyze and optimize feed costs. The platform integrates real-time price updates and provides an interactive interface for users to explore ingredient choices. Using data extracted from the Animal Nutrition Booklet by NDDB, the system allows for cost optimization and helps users make data-driven decisions.

Key Features:

- Data Extraction & Analysis: Extracted and analyzed data for 180+ ingredients from the Animal Nutrition Booklet by NDDB, ensuring accurate and up-to-date nutritional values.

- Real-Time Price Updates: Streamlined price updates for ingredients, ensuring cost-effectiveness in feed formulation.

- Interactive User Interface: Developed an interactive platform using Streamlit, allowing users to easily input data and view optimization results.

- Optimization with Google OR-Tools: Implemented optimization techniques using Google OR-Tools, enabling cost-effective feed formulations based on nutritional requirements.

- Enhanced User Engagement: Designed the platform to enhance user engagement through an intuitive, interactive interface, supporting data-driven decision-making.
